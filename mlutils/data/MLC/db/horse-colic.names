| 
|   1:  surgery?
|           1 = Yes, it had surgery
|           2 = It was treated without surgery
| 
|   2:  Age 
|           1 = Adult horse
|           2 = Young (< 6 months)
| 
|   3:  Hospital Number 
|           - numeric id
|           - the case number assigned to the horse
|             (may not be unique if the horse is treated > 1 time)
| 
|   4:  rectal temperature
|           - linear
|           - in degrees celsius.
|           - An elevated temp may occur due to infection.
|           - temperature may be reduced when the animal is in late shock
|           - normal temp is 37.8
|           - this parameter will usually change as the problem progresses
|                eg. may start out normal, then become elevated because of
|                    the lesion, passing back through the normal range as the
|                    horse goes into shock
|   5:  pulse 
|           - linear
|           - the heart rate in beats per minute
|           - is a reflection of the heart condition: 30 -40 is normal for adults
|           - rare to have a lower than normal rate although athletic horses
|             may have a rate of 20-25
|           - animals with painful lesions or suffering from circulatory shock
|             may have an elevated heart rate
| 
|   6:  respiratory rate
|           - linear
|           - normal rate is 8 to 10
|           - usefulness is doubtful due to the great fluctuations
| 
|   7:  temperature of extremities
|           - a subjective indication of peripheral circulation
|           - possible values:
|                1 = Normal
|                2 = Warm
|                3 = Cool
|                4 = Cold
|           - cool to cold extremities indicate possible shock
|           - hot extremities should correlate with an elevated rectal temp.
| 
|   8:  peripheral pulse
|           - subjective
|           - possible values are:
|                1 = normal
|                2 = increased
|                3 = reduced
|                4 = absent
|           - normal or increased p.p. are indicative of adequate circulation
|             while reduced or absent indicate poor perfusion
| 
|   9:  mucous membranes
|           - a subjective measurement of colour
|           - possible values are:
|                1 = normal pink
|                2 = bright pink
|                3 = pale pink
|                4 = pale cyanotic
|                5 = bright red / injected
|                6 = dark cyanotic
|           - 1 and 2 probably indicate a normal or slightly increased
|             circulation
|           - 3 may occur in early shock
|           - 4 and 6 are indicative of serious circulatory compromise
|           - 5 is more indicative of a septicemia
| 
|  10: capillary refill time
|           - a clinical judgement. The longer the refill, the poorer the
|             circulation
|           - possible values
|                1 = < 3 seconds
|                2 = >= 3 seconds
| 
|  11: pain - a subjective judgement of the horse's pain level
|           - possible values:
|                1 = alert, no pain
|                2 = depressed
|                3 = intermittent mild pain
|                4 = intermittent severe pain
|                5 = continuous severe pain
|           - should NOT be treated as a ordered or discrete variable!
|           - In general, the more painful, the more likely it is to require
|             surgery
|           - prior treatment of pain may mask the pain level to some extent
| 
|  12: peristalsis                              
|           - an indication of the activity in the horse's gut. As the gut
|             becomes more distended or the horse becomes more toxic, the
|             activity decreases
|           - possible values:
|                1 = hypermotile
|                2 = normal
|                3 = hypomotile
|                4 = absent
| 
|  13: abdominal distension
|           - An IMPORTANT parameter.
|           - possible values
|                1 = none
|                2 = slight
|                3 = moderate
|                4 = severe
|           - an animal with abdominal distension is likely to be painful and
|             have reduced gut motility.
|           - a horse with severe abdominal distension is likely to require
|             surgery just tio relieve the pressure
| 
|  14: nasogastric tube
|           - this refers to any gas coming out of the tube
|           - possible values:
|                1 = none
|                2 = slight
|                3 = significant
|           - a large gas cap in the stomach is likely to give the horse
|             discomfort
| 
|  15: nasogastric reflux
|           - possible values
|                1 = none
|                2 = > 1 liter
|                3 = < 1 liter
|           - the greater amount of reflux, the more likelihood that there is
|             some serious obstruction to the fluid passage from the rest of
|             the intestine
| 
|  16: nasogastric reflux PH
|           - linear
|           - scale is from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral
|           - normal values are in the 3 to 4 range
| 
|  17: rectal examination - feces
|           - possible values
|                1 = normal
|                2 = increased
|                3 = decreased
|                4 = absent
|           - absent feces probably indicates an obstruction
| 
|  18: abdomen
|           - possible values
|                1 = normal
|                2 = other
|                3 = firm feces in the large intestine
|                4 = distended small intestine
|                5 = distended large intestine
|           - 3 is probably an obstruction caused by a mechanical impaction
|             and is normally treated medically
|           - 4 and 5 indicate a surgical lesion
| 
|  19: packed cell volume
|           - linear
|           - the # of red cells by volume in the blood
|           - normal range is 30 to 50. The level rises as the circulation
|             becomes compromised or as the animal becomes dehydrated.
| 
|  20: total protein
|           - linear
|           - normal values lie in the 6-7.5 (gms/dL) range
|           - the higher the value the greater the dehydration
| 
|  21: abdominocentesis appearance
|           - a needle is put in the horse's abdomen and fluid is obtained from
|             the abdominal cavity
|           - possible values:
|                1 = clear
|                2 = cloudy
|                3 = serosanguinous
|           - normal fluid is clear while cloudy or serosanguinous indicates
|             a compromised gut
| 
|  22: abdomcentesis total protein
|           - linear
|           - the higher the level of protein the more likely it is to have a
|             compromised gut. Values are in gms/dL
| 
|  23: outcome
|           - what eventually happened to the horse?
|           - possible values:
|                1 = lived
|                2 = died
|                3 = was euthanized
| 
|  24: surgical lesion?
|           - retrospectively, was the problem (lesion) surgical?
|           - all cases are either operated upon or autopsied so that
|             this value and the lesion type are always known
|           - possible values:
|                1 = Yes
|                2 = No
| 
|  25, 26, 27: type of lesion
|           - first number is site of lesion
|                1 = gastric
|                2 = sm intestine
|                3 = lg colon
|                4 = lg colon and cecum
|                5 = cecum
|                6 = transverse colon
|                7 = retum/descending colon
|                8 = uterus
|                9 = bladder
|                11 = all intestinal sites
|                00 = none
|           - second number is type
|                1 = simple
|                2 = strangulation
|                3 = inflammation
|                4 = other
|           - third number is subtype
|                1 = mechanical
|                2 = paralytic
|                0 = n/a
|           - fourth number is specific code
|                1 = obturation
|                2 = intrinsic
|                3 = extrinsic
|                4 = adynamic
|                5 = volvulus/torsion
|                6 = intussuption
|                7 = thromboembolic
|                8 = hernia
|                9 = lipoma/slenic incarceration
|                10 = displacement
|                0 = n/a
|  28: cp_data
|           - is pathology data present for this case?
|                1 = Yes
|                2 = No
|           - this variable is of no significance since pathology data
|             is not included or collected for these cases
|
