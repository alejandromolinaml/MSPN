|     I do not have that paper, but have found what is probably a later
|     variation of that figure in Stepp's dissertation, which lists the
|     value "normal" for the first 2 classes and "irrelevant" for the latter
|     2 classes.  I believe that "irrelevant" is used here as a synonym for
|     "not-applicable", "dna", and "does-not-apply".  I believe that there
|     is a mis-print in the figure he read in their PAMI-83 article.
|  
|     I have checked over each attribute value in this database.  It 
|     corresponds exactly with the copies listed in both Stepp's and Fisher's
|     dissertations.
