|4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
|    There are 19 classes, only the first 15 of which have been used in prior
|    work.  The folklore seems to be that the last four classes are
|    unjustified by the data since they have so few examples.
|    There are 35 categorical attributes, some nominal and some ordered.  The
|    value ``dna'' means does not apply.  The values for attributes are
|    encoded numerically, with the first value encoded as ``0,'' the second as
|    ``1,'' and so forth.  An unknown values is encoded as ``-1.''
