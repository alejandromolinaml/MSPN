|     The BILIRUBIN attribute appears to be continuously-valued.  I checked
|     this with the donater, Bojan Cestnik, who replied:
| 
|       About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say
|       the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's
|       "values" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); "values" are quoted
|       because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such 
|       thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called
|       "boundary" values; according to these "boundary" values the attribute
|       can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious
|       attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous
|       information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly 
|       answered your question.
